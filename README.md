# Template for short-and-sweet lightning talks

## Inspiration/background

* https://www.chessable.com/chess-openings/s/short%20sweet
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk

## Why

**If** you want to 

* share a use-case/problem solution from your project
* share experience with a technology/tool/framework
* dive (deeper) into new topics
* learn by doing

**then** a lightning talk is what you need!

The goal of the short-and-sweet talk is not to provide an extensive teach-in experience - it's about knowledge sharing and inspiration to dive deeper later.

## What

* slides (Markdown/AsciiDoc)
  * you might want to use Marp (https://marpit.marp.app) in VSCode + Marp extension
    * see also https://github.com/yhatt/marp-cli-example
* code
* script/helper snippers to speed up the demo


## When

TBD, most probably at lunch time aka 'Brown Bag Meeting' - simply announce and/or book the next available slot.

Overall duration should be around 15-30 mins to reserve enough time to come to the meat of the talk **and** to have 5-10 mins for Q&A

## How

* prepare the [What](##What)
  * based on this template
  * let https://github.com/OpenValue-D fork it
* book the [When](##When)
* and have fun
